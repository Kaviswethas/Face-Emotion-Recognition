# ðŸ§  Face Emotion Recognition
This project uses a webcam to detect human faces and recognize their emotions in real time using deep learning. It leverages OpenCV for video capture and the facial_emotion_recognition library (based on PyTorch) to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprise, and more.

# ðŸ”§ Features
- Real-time face detection from webcam
- Emotion recognition using pre-trained deep learning model
- Runs on CPU (no GPU required)

# ðŸš€ Requirements
- Python 3.9.6
- OpenCV
- torch
- facial_emotion_recognition

# CMD Libray Installation

To install the facial_emotion_recognition library use
>> pip install facial-emotion-recognition

To install the PyTorch library use
>> pip install opencv-python torch

# Change the Syntax in the facial_emotion_recognition.py file
